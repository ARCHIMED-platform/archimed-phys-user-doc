# Data

To run an ARCHIMED simulation, you'll need a working example. Please download it from here: 

{{%attachments pattern=\"example_inputs.zip\" /%}}

At the moment, don't worry about the organization of the folder nor the file contents. We'll get into this very soon in the [organization page](../../2-inputs/1-organisation/).

# ARCHIMED executable

ARCHIMED is programmed in Java. The main benefit is that a same `.jar` file can be executed in all platforms compatible with Java (*i.e.* Windows, Mac, Linux...). 
Please download the executable (e.g. `archimed.jar`) and place it at the root of the example directory (meaning next to the `config.yml` file).
