# Command details

We saw earlier that a simulation is started using the following command line:

```shell
java -jar archimed-phys.jar config.yml
```

The `java -jar archimed-phys.jar` part of the command just tells Java to execute the `archimed.jar` file, and the second one (`config.yml`) is an argument used to give the path to the configuration file to ARCHIMED-φ.

But more options are also available from ARCHIMED-φ. 

To get all the options from ARCHIMED-φ, you can consult the help by running it without any argument:

```shell
java -jar archimed-phys.jar
```

It will return something as follow (depending on the version):

```

   --scattering-end-method <arg>  scattering iteration ending method (0,1,2)```
```

You can run ARCHIMED-φ with any of these options enabled, but at the moment it is best not digging into much details about this. We will see those details later in the [documentation for power users](../../2-inputs/7-power_users/).
