<h1>Data</h1>
<p>To run an ARCHIMED simulation, you’ll need a working example. Please download it from here:</p>
<p>{{%attachments pattern="example_inputs.zip" /%}}</p>
<p>At the moment, don’t worry about the organization of the folder nor the file contents. We’ll get into this very soon in the <a href="../../2-inputs/1-organisation/">organization page</a>.</p>

<div id="archimed-executable" class="section level1">
<h1>ARCHIMED executable</h1>
<p>ARCHIMED is programmed in Java. The main benefit is that a same <code>.jar</code> file can be executed in all platforms compatible with Java (<em>i.e.</em> Windows, Mac, Linux…).
Please download the executable (e.g. <code>archimed.jar</code>) and place it at the root of the example directory (meaning next to the <code>config.yml</code> file).</p>
