<h1>Data</h1>
<p>To run an ARCHIMED-φ simulation, you’ll need a working example. Please download it from here:</p>
<p>{{%attachments pattern="example_inputs.zip" /%}}</p>
<p>At the moment, don’t worry about the organization of the folder or the file contents. We’ll get into this very soon in the <a href="../../3-inputs/1-organisation/">organization page</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="archimed-φ-executable" class="section level1">
<h1>ARCHIMED-φ executable</h1>
<p>ARCHIMED-φ is programmed in Java. The main benefit is that a same <code>.jar</code> file can be executed in all platforms compatible with Java (<em>i.e.</em> Windows, Mac, Linux…).
Please download the executable (e.g. <code>archimed-phys.jar</code>):</p>
<p>{{%attachments pattern="archimed-phys.jar" /%}}</p>
<p>Then, place it at the root of the example directory, <em>i.e.</em> next to the <code>config.yml</code> file.</p>
<p>{{% notice note %}}
You can place <code>archimed-phys.jar</code> wherever you please, but it is good practice to place the executable in the folder of each simulation project for enhanced reproducibility.
