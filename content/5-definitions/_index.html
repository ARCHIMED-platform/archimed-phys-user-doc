<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shortwave radiation</strong>: light in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths (400-3000 nm) <em>i.e.</em> PAR and NIR. UV light is ignored in Archimed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Longwave radiation</strong>: light in the thermal infrared wavelengths (&gt;3000 nanometers), also called TIR in the model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PAR</strong>: photosynthetically active radiation. Wave band of solar radiation in the ~400 to 700 nanometers range that photosynthetic organisms are able to use in the process of photosynthesis. Also called visible light.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NIR</strong>: near-infrared radiation. Wave band of solar radiation in the ~780 to 3000 nanometers range, participating in the energy balance of the system. In fact NIR in Archimed encompass near-infrared (780-1400 nm) and short-wavelengt infrared (1400-3000 nm).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TIR</strong>: thermal infrared radiation. Wave band of solar radiation &gt; 3000 nanometers. It is simply called thermal infrared radiation because grey-body radiation from objects in Archimed applications is almost all at far infrared wavelengths. It encompass mid (3000-8000 nm), long (8000-15000 nm) and far-wavelength (15000 nm - 1 mm) infrared radiation.</p></li>
