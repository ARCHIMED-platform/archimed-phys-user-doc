### Chapter 2

# Model outputs

The models outputs for a simulation are stored in a single folder given by the options in the `config.yaml` input file (see [this section](../3-inputs/2-general_config/) for more details). 

This chapter details the content of each output file. An example simulation output folder can be downloaded here to follow along:

{{%attachments pattern=\"simdir.zip\" /%}}
