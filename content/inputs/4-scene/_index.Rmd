# 3D scene

The 3D scene is defined using several files. First, individual objects are defined using: 

- `.opf` files for plants. These files describe the geometry and topology of the plant;
- `.gwa` objects for any other object, than defines its geometry.

Then, a scene file (`.ops`) is used to place these individual objects in a 3D scene.
