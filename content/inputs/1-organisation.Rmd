# Inputs organisation

Several input files are mandatory for an ARCHIMED simulation: the general configuration file (`config.yml`), the meteorology data (`meteo.csv`), the models configuration (*e.g.* `plant_coffee.yml`), and the scene (e.g. `.ops` and `.opf` files). There is also an input file for the physical constants (`const.yml`) that is optional because ARCHIMED defines default values if not provided.

An example folder containing several examples can be downloaded here:

It is recommended to follow along with these files opened in your preferred editor. We recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). They are both open source and have packages to view and edit YAML (`.yml`), CSV (`.csv`) and XML files (`.ops`, `.opf` and `.gwa`).

Here is a tree view of the files and folders with a little description for each:

```bash
ðŸ“¦
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œconfig.yml               # -> Here is the general configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œconfig_vox.yml           # -> Same here, but for a voxel scene
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œconst.yml                # -> constants used in the model
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œmeteo.csv                # -> the meteorology file
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚model                    # -> all the models configuration files are listed in this folder
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œlight_interception_net.yml # An example model config for artificial nets
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œplant_anchor_test.yml # An example config using anchors
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œplant_coffee.yml      # An example config for a Coffea plant
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œplant_coffee_future_implementations.yml # example of config with future implementations in ARCHIMED.
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œplant_elaeis.yml      # An example config for an oil palm plant
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œsoil.yml              # An example config for a soil
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œturbid_medium.yml     # An example config for a turbid medium (i.e. voxels)
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“œvirtual_sensor.yml    # An example config for virtual sensors
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚scene                     # -> all the 3D scenes files are listed in this folder
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œcafeier.ops           # An example scene with one coffee
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚opf                   # The folder that list the available `.opf` files for the plant geometry
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“œP6_Ru_ii_L2P02.opf # An example coffee plant geometry ad topology
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“œpavement.gwa          # An example pavement file (usually generated using the `soil.yml` file)
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“œsoil.yml                  # An example soil file
```

Many input files use the YAML format. It is a data serialization language designed to be directly writable and readable by humans. There are tons of resources on the web (*e.g.* [learnxinyminutes.com](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), [this blog post](https://rollout.io/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started/)), but you should be fine just by seeing the files structure. 

{{% notice note %}}
The names of the input files are not mandatory, but it is best to keep a rather standard naming nevertheless. For example `soil.yml` can become `soil_1.yml` or `soil_montpellier.yml`, but it is still recommended to keep "soil" in the name.
