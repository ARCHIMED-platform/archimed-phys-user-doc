<h1>3D scene</h1>
<p>The 3D scene is defined using several files. First, individual objects are defined using:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.opf</code> files for plants. These files describe the geometry and topology of the plant;</li>
<li><code>.gwa</code> objects for any other object, than defines its geometry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, a scene file (<code>.ops</code>) is used to place these individual objects in a 3D scene. This chapter presents the details about the scene files.</p>
