# `meteo.csv`

The meteorology file is used to input variables related to the environment. It is a file prepared in the CSV format where each column is a variable, and each line is a time step. A time step is a given period of time, it can be a period of 1 minute or a period of 100 days (but see [section about that](#thoughts))).

The duration of a time step is up to the user, and mainly depends on the use-case, the variables requested and the precision needed. 
Shorter time-steps tends to give best results because they allow the model to better integrate the variability of the conditions happening on short duration (*e.g* change in shading of a leaf will change many outputs) that are not well integrated otherwise because the processes are not linear. 
But there is a trade-off between the number of steps and their duration that leads the computation intensity. For example if we need to simulate one day at 30-minute time-steps, it will require 48 time-steps in total, bu only 24 with one hour time-steps.




## Some thought on time steps duration {#thoughts}

In general we recommend time-steps of maximum 30-minutes for simulations with biophysical processes (*e.g.* photosynthesis, energy balance, transpiration). This is based on the assumption that these variables can be safely considered at steady-state at or below a 30-minute time range.

If only the light interception of order 0 (first hit) is needed, the time step can be much larger because the model use the true position of the sun every `radiation_timestep` (parameter from the [configuration file](../2-general_config/index.html#simulation-controls)). Be carefull when using light scattering though, because it is biased when simulating long durations at one time, please prefer using shorter time-steps for such applications
