<h1><code>meteo.csv</code></h1>
<p>The meteorology file is used to input variables related to the environment. It is a CSV-formatted file where each column is a variable, and each line is a time step. A time step is a given period of time, it can be a period of 1 minute as much as a period of 100 days.</p>
<p>The duration of a time step is up to the user, and mainly depends on the use-case, the variables requested and the precision needed.
Shorter time-steps tends to give best results because they allow the model to better integrate the variability of the conditions happening on short duration (<em>e.g</em> change in shading of a leaf will change many outputs) that are not well integrated otherwise because the processes are not linear.
But there is a trade-off between the number of steps and their duration that leads the computation intensity. For example if we need to simulate one day at 30-minute time-steps, it will require 48 time-steps in total, bu only 24 with one hour time-steps.</p>
<p>In general we recommend time-steps of maximum 30-minutes for simulations with biophysical processes (<em>e.g.</em> photosynthesis, energy balance, transpiration). This is based on the assumption that these variables can be safely considered at steady-state at or below a 30-minute time range.</p>
<p>If only the light interception of order 0 (first hit) is needed, the time step can be much larger because the model use the true position of the sun every <code>radiation_timestep</code> (parameter from the <a href="../2-general_config/index.html#simulation-controls">configuration file</a>)</p>
