<h1><code>meteo.csv</code></h1>
<p>The meteorology file is used to input variables related to the environment. It is a file prepared in the CSV format where each column is a variable, and each line is a time step. A time step is a given period of time, it can be a period of 1 minute or a period of 100 days (but see the <a href="#thoughts">section about that</a> below).</p>
<div id="file-format" class="section level3">
<h3>File format</h3>
<p>The file is a CSV file (semicolon separated) enriched by optional parameters as comments in the header (and following the <code>YAML</code> format).</p>
<p>You can download an example file here:</p>
<p>{{%attachments pattern="meteo.csv" /%}}</p>
<p>The file is structured as follows:</p>
<pre><code>#&#39; name: Aquiares
#&#39; latitude: 15.0  # in degrees
#&#39; altitude: 100.0 # in meters
#&#39; use : relativeHumidity clearness
date;hour_start;hour_end;temperature;relativeHumidity;VPD;clearness;Re_SW_f;wind;atmosphereCO2_ppm
2016/06/12;12:00:00;12:30:00;25;60;150;0.75;500;1;380
2016/06/12;12:30:00;13:00:00;26;62;150;0.75;500;1.5;380
2016/06/12;13:00:00;13:30:00;25.3;58;150;0.75;500;1.5;380</code></pre>
<p>The four lines at the beginning are <code>YAML</code>-formatted metadata used as input parameters for ARCHIMED-φ. They define properties of the site where the data was measured. The first one is the name of the site (completely free), then comes its <code>latitude</code> (degrees) and <code>altitude</code> (meters). The <code>use</code> parameter defines which column is used when several related (i.e. concurrent) variables are defined in the data. In our example the <code>relativeHumidity</code> and the <code>VPD</code> are declared, and the user must choose which one to use.</p>
<p>The first line after the commented lines defines the column names. These names are all fixed and should be matched exactly (ARCHIMED-φ is case-sensitive).</p>
<p>Here is a table summarizing the information about those variables:</p>

<h3>Variables details</h3>
<div id="light" class="section level4">
<h4>Light</h4>
<p>The date and hours are used to compute the sun position in the sky for the computation of the light interception.</p>
<p>The <code>clearness</code>, <code>Ri_SW_f</code>, <code>Ri_PAR_f</code>, <code>Ri_NIR_f</code>, and <code>Ri_xxx_f</code> are also related to the light interception computation.</p>
<p>The total energy coming from solar radiation at earth surface is mainly between 400 and 2500-3000 nm (see Fig. 1).</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Fig. 1: Solar irradiance spectrum above atmosphere and at earth surface. Source: wikimedia</p>
</div>
<p>The spectrum of incoming solar radiation is simplified into two wavebands in ARCHIMED-φ:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Ri_PAR_f</code> is the photosynthetically active radiation flux coming from the atmosphere. It typically ranges from 400 to 700 nm (i.e. visible part of the light), and is the radiation primarily used for plant photosynthesis.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Ri_NIR_f</code> is the Near Infrared radiation flux coming from the atmosphere. It typically ranges from 700 to 3000 nm and is more precisely defined by the sum of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared#Regions_within_the_infrared">NIR and SWIR</a> wavebands.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These two wavebands represent the short wave radiation flux coming from the atmosphere. And their sum gives <code>Ri_SW_f</code>, with the PAR radiation representing typically 48% and the NIR 52%.</p>
<p>The long wave radiation (TIR, i.e. thermal infrared) is the radiation emitted by any object due to its surface temperature. It is possible to provide the TIR coming from the atmosphere as an input to ARCHIMED-φ by providing the <code>Ri_TIR_f</code> variable.</p>
<p>These variables are not necessarily measured, so ARCHIMED-φ provides a simpler way to parameterize the incoming radiation by using a simpler variable: the <code>clearness</code>. Indeed, it is simple to compute the extraterrestrial solar radiation (i.e. the radiation in yellow in Fig. 1) at a given location and time, but this radiation is partly absorbed, diffused and reflected by the atmosphere before getting to the ground. These effects are mainly driven by the composition of the atmosphere, which can be approximated (coarsely) by the <code>clearness</code> of the sky, <em>i.e.</em> the oposite of the cloud cover in the sky. It ranges from 0 (sky full of clouds) to 1 (clear sky), but values rarely goes below 0.2 or above 0.8.</p>
<p>If any of these variable is missing, the model computes it, providing at least one of the <code>clearness</code>, <code>Ri_SW_f</code>, <code>Ri_PAR_f</code>, <code>Ri_NIR_f</code> is given. Please keep in mind the more variables are provided as inputs, the lower the simulation error because it is preferable to measure a variable than simulating it.</p>
<p>The user can also input any custom waveband for the incoming light using the “<code>Ri_xxx_f</code>” naming convention, <em>e.g.</em> for the red band: <code>Ri_red_f</code>. These custom wavebands can be used to compute the light interception and scattering for any waveband, but they don’t participate to the energy balance nor the photosynthesis (the shortwave is already conputed using PAR and NIR).</p>
<p>{{% notice info %}}
The custom wavebands must be part of the shortwave band, and the optical properties of the components in the scene must be provided (see <a href="../5-models/2-models_list/">this section</a> for more information).

<div id="micro-environment" class="section level4">
<h4>Micro-environment</h4>
<p>The <code>temperature</code>, <code>relativeHumidity</code>, <code>VPD</code>, <code>wind</code> and <code>atmosphereCO2_ppm</code> are used for the biophysical computations, such as the energy balance and photosynthesis.</p>
<p>If the <code>relativeHumidity</code> is not given, the model uses the <code>VPD</code>, but one or the other must be provided. If the <code>atmosphereCO2_ppm</code> is not given in the meteo file, it is read from the constant parameter file (<code>const.yml</code>, see <a href="../3-constants/">this section</a> for more details).</p>

<div id="thoughts" class="section level3">
<h3>Some thought on time steps duration</h3>
<p>The duration of a time step is up to the user, and mainly depends on the use-case, the variables requested and the precision needed.
Shorter time-steps tends to give best results because they allow to better integrate non-linear processes that are not well integrated otherwise (<em>e.g.</em> a rapid change in the incoming radiation on a leaf can impact greatly its energy balance).</p>
<p>In general we recommend time-steps of maximum 30-minutes for simulations with biophysical processes (<em>e.g.</em> photosynthesis, energy balance, transpiration). This is based on the assumption that these variables can be safely considered at steady-state at or below a 30-minute time range.</p>
<p>If only the light interception is needed, the time step can be much larger because the model use the true position of the sun every <code>radiation_timestep</code> (parameter from the <a href="../2-general_config/index.html#simulation-controls">configuration file</a>), and not every step in the meteorology file.</p>
<p>For all other variables, there is a trade-off between the duration of each step and their number to optimize both the predictions and the time of computation. For example if we need to simulate one day at 30-minute time-steps, it will require 48 time-steps in total, bu only 24 with one hour time-steps. The latter simulation will be almost twice as fast as the former, but will probably lead to a greater simulation error compared with measurements.</p>
<p>{{% notice info %}}
The <code>cache_radiation</code> parameter can alleviate this effect though (parameter from the <a href="../2-general_config/index.html#simulation-controls">configuration file</a>). It allows to compute the results of the light interception for each direction relative to the global radiation, and to cache the results for further use in other time-steps. It is generally admitted this parameter should be set to <code>true</code> when the number of time-steps to simulate is greater than the number of directions (due to overheads on computing the cached radiation).
